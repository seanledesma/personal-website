        <h2>Without End</h2>
        <p class = "haiku">
            Earth spins around<br>Rising Sun reaches further<br>Twisting without end.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The inspiration for this Haiku is the helical model <br>the Sun and Earth take as they drift through space.

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been interested in computers and elctronics. When I was a teenager you could usually find me tinkering<br>
            with something. I almost killed the family computer on several occasions because I had downloaded some virus while <br>
            tinkering with it. I didn't have my own personal computer, so most of my time was spent on my android phone. <br>
            I unlocked the bootloader, rooted it, and started installing custom firmware. <br>

        </p>
        <p>
            Besides messing around with my computer and cell phone, I've also had a great interest in<br>
            video making and editing. I rented video equipment from my High School on several occasions,<br>
            using it to create short youtube videos with my friends. I became more and more proficient with<br>
            Adobe Premiere Pro, although I don't do much of that these days.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I'm more interested programming and networking. I've been setting up my own personal home server,<br>
            I run ProxMox which is a HyperVisor OS, and then I run Debian Linux on top of that in a VM. This way <br>
            I'm able to spin up more OS's in VM's if I wanted. Inside Debian I run Docker, which I access from the web <br>
            using something called Portainer. From Docker I run a whole bunch of services, such as Pi-Hole, Plex, <br>
            NextCloud and Home Assistant.
