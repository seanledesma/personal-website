The code for my personal website, seanledesma.com

Right now, the website is a landing page for all other projects I've done in my web programming classes.
The landing page was my final project. Feel free to check out the code or the website itself using the link below.

I am planning on changing the website up in the future to act as a more professional portfolio for my work.
